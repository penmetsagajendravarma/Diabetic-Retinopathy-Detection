# Preprocessing of Diabetic Retinopathy Images 📷

I applied several image processing techniques like:
- ➡️ Gaussian blurring
- ➡️ Contrast stretching
- ➡️ Histogram equalization
- ➡️ Ben Graham preprocessing technique

and finally compared all these techniques to come out with the best one.

## Applying Histogram Equalization to the Gaussian Noise-Added Image

I have used several deep learning architectures like:
- ➡️ CNN
- ➡️ VGG16
- ➡️ EfficientNetB0
- ➡️ Resnet50
